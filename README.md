# React Loaders

My goal in writing this project was to control the types of loading in a React application. In this project, I controlled the loading of the application, fetching data from the external API, and the actions that are performed in the buttons or forms and showed it to the user.

âœŒ I plan to convert this project into an npm package.

### Run app
```bash
npm run start
```
