# React Loaders

My goal in building this project was to manage loadings throughout the application. I created several `components`, custom `hooks` and `contexts` in this project to manage all page loadings and actions performed in forms and simply show dynamic loadings to the user.

âœŒ I plan to convert this project into an npm package.

### Run app
```bash
npm run start
```
